# Python_Diwali_Sales_Anaysis

The Diwali Sales Analysis project focuses on uncovering key insights from festive-season sales data to help businesses optimize marketing and sales strategies. By analyzing customer demographics, purchasing behavior, and spending patterns during the Diwali season, the project identifies top-performing products, customer segments, and regions contributing to higher revenue.

Built using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn), this analysis transforms raw transactional data into actionable insights. Visualizations highlight trends in gender-based purchases, age group preferences, state-wise performance, and high-value customers.

The project aims to assist businesses in understanding consumer behavior during festive periods, enabling data-driven decisions for targeted promotions and improved sales performance in future campaigns.
